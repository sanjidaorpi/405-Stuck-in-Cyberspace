# 405 Stuck In Cyberspace

An experimental exploration of poetry in digital space, where the boundary between reader and text dissolves into interactive experience.

---

## Overview

**Stuck In Cyberspace** presents original poems through an immersive, camera-based interface that responds to your physical presence and gestures.  
The text appears mirrored on screen, creating a unique relationship between reader, poem, and digital space.

## Features

### Gesture-Based Navigation
- Navigate between poems using hand gestures in front of your camera
- Perform scrolling motions in the air to advance to the next poem
- No keyboard or mouse interaction required

### Dynamic Display Modes

**Background Modes**
- **Solid Color (Default):** Clean background for optimal text readability
- **Video Mode:** Toggle the ON/OFF button to overlay text directly onto your live camera feed, creating a mask effect over your face

**Text Positioning**
- **FREE Mode:** Text appears mirrored and masked over your image
- **READ Mode:** Click the READ button for static text positioning with traditional readability

### Proximity Detection
- Text only displays when you're within the appropriate distance threshold
- A guidance message appears if you move too far or too close
- Maintains consistent text size and clarity based on your position
