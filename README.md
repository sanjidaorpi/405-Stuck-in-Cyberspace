405 Stuck In Cyberspace

An experimental exploration of poetry in digital space, where the boundary between reader and text dissolves into interactive experience.

  Stuck In Cyberspace presents original poems through an immersive, camera-based interface that responds to your physical presence and gestures. The text appears mirrored on screen, creating a unique relationship between reader, poem, and digital space.

Background Modes:
  Solid Color (Default): Clean background for optimal text readability
